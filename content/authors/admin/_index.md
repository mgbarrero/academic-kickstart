Since 2016 I am a postdoctoral researcher at the National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity (ATHENE), Germany. Before that, I received my MSc degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics, and her PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, in 2011 and 2016, respectively.  My current research focuses on security and privacy evaluations of biometric systems, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) methodologies, and biometric template protection (BTP) schemes. I have also received a number of distinctions, including: EAB European Biometric Industry Award 2015, Best Ph.D. Thesis Award by Universidad Autonoma de Madrid 2015/16, Siew-Sngiem Best Paper Award at ICB 2015, Archimedes Award for young researches from Spanish MECD and Best Poster Award at ICB 2013.
