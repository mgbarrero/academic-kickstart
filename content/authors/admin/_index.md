I am Full Professor for machine learning at the Universität der Bundeswehr München since 2023, head of the [BioML: Biometrics and Machine Learning](https://www.unibw.de/bioml-en) research group, and I am also affiliated with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Before that I was a Research Professor at the Hochschule Ansbach. Between 2016 and 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity (ATHENE) - Hochschule Darmstadt. I received my MSc degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics (2011), and my PhD degree in Electrical Engineering (2016) from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain. 

I am general chair of the BIOSIG conference and have served for several conferences (e.g., IJCB, IWBF, EUSIPCO, ICASSP, WIFS) and journals (e.g., IEEE TIFS, IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TBIOM, IET BMT, Elsevier PR). Further, I am Deputy Chair of the European Association for Biometrics (EAB), Chair of the BIOSIG special interest group of the Geselllschaft für Informatik (GI), associate editor for the EURASIP Journals on Information Security and on Image and Video Processing, Member of the IARP TC4 Conference Committee, the IEEE Biometrics Council Security and Privacy Technical Committee, and the IEEE Information and Forensics Technical Committee, and represent the German Institute for Standardisation (DIN) in ISO/IEC SC37 JTC1 SC37 on biometrics. I have also been involved in several international research project (ANR-DFG RESPECT; EU SOTAMD, BEAT, and TABULA RASA; IARPA BATL).
